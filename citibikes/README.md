For this project, our original ideas include test whether or not # bikes in Manhatten is larger than any other boroghs, but the challenge part is we couldn't successfully delineate the other boroghs' limit based on the current data.

Then we looked back our professor's example, after discussion, we made the final decision: to test the proportion of young people(we assume the age is 35) whoes trip duration is more than 30min, and the proportion of old people(assume the age is above 35) whoes trip duration is more than 30min.  our alt hypothesis is young people's long trip duration is higher than old people.

Then we split the task, my contribution is to figure the z-score of the two proportion, my method is to calculate each group's number(trip duration is more than 30 min),then get each group's proportion ,accordingly. Then compare thZ-se proportion, I use the formula of Z-score, then get the P-value of the Z-score, which is big enough to reject the null hypothesis.
